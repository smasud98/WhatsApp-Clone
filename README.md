# WhatsApp-Clone
This project is a full-stack web application using Node, Express, MongoDB, and React to construct a clone of WhatsApp. Following the youtube tutorial by Clever Programmer, this project was to practice fundamental concepts using the entire MERN stack. This application also made use of Pusher; a great tool to enable real-time data updates between MongoDB and the clients.
